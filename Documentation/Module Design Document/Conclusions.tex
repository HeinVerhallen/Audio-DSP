Due to time constrains the final project is not yet working. The hardware main board has been tested for as far as possible and works for as far as could be tested. Also all the vertical riser boards have been tested and validated as shown in the verification chapter. The firmware that has been developed for the product has been tested in ModelSim and works there, but still has to be implemented in combination with the hardware.

\noindent During testing of the DE1-SOC board a problem has been found. The clock signal that goes from the FPGA to the DACs and ADCs is not working properly. The output of the DE1-SOC FPGA board seems to be to capacitive due to parasitics of the board design and therefore the clock signal gets filtered down and is not picked up by the ADCs and DACs. The schematic of the FPGA board shows that there is a 47 Ohm series resistor, this in combination with the RDS(on) of the internal switching FETs of the Cyclone-V and the capacitance of the TVS diode in parallel with the parasitic capacitance of the PCB seems to cause the clock signal to be filtered out as an Rc-LPF. The measurements where done on the DE1-SOC board that was not connected to the Main board of the DSP to exclude our main board and flat cable from this conclusion.
