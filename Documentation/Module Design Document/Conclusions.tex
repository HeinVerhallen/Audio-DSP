Due to time constrains the final project is not yet working. The hardware main board has been tested for as far as possible and works, also all the vertical riser boards have been tested and validated as shown in the verification chapter. The firmware that has been developed for the product has been tested in ModelSim and works there, but still has to be implemented in combination with the hardware.

\noindent During testing of the DE1-Soc board a potential problem has been found. The clock signal that goes from the FPGA to the DAC's and ADC's might not be working properly. The output of the FPGA board seems to be to capacitive and therefore the clock signal gets filtered down and might not be picked up by the ADC's and DAC's. the schematic of the FPGA board shows that there is a 47 ohm series resistor, this in combination with the RDS-on of the switching FETs and the capacitance of the TVS diode in parallel with the parasitic capacitance of the PCB seems to cause the clock signal to be filtered out. The measurements where done on the DE1-Soc board that was not connected to the Main board of the DSP.
