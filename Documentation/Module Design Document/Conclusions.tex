Due to time constrains the hardware mother board has not yet been delivered and therefore it could not be assembled and tested altogether. The firmware is also not yet implemented so not every effect could have been tested. Therefore it is not yet known whether the system works correctly or not. This has to be verified once the PCBs are ready and the firmware has been implemented in the FPGA.
