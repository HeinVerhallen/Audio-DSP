\subsection{I2S decoder and encoder}
The ADC and DAC use I2S to transfer the sampled audio data to the FPGA. This protocol needs to be decoded to obtain the actual data, processed and be encoded again to I2S to send to the DAC. The VHDL code that has been written for this can be found in \nameref{chap:appendix-B-vhdl}. 

\subsection{I2C controller}
The DAC must be configured with I2C. To be able to do this an I2C master must be programmed in the FPGA. This I2C master initializes the DAC with default configurations. The VHDL code of the I2C master can be found in \nameref{chap:appendix-B-vhdl}. 

\subsection{Band-pass filter}


\subsection{Sinewave generator}
In order to test the band-pass filter effect and the other effects, a sinewave generator is made to easily compare the input to the output of the effect. This makes the verification of the different effects very easy. The sinewave generator has an input that specifies the frequency of the generated sinewave. The VHDL code can be found in \nameref{chap:appendix-B-vhdl}.
