The aim of this project was to fully develop an audio digital signal processor. During the project we researched and developed what it takes to make a working digital signal processor with a custom PCB and an FPGA-board. To house this we researched the ideal layout of the circuit boards and ports.

\noindent This paper shows the research and design process of the audio digital signal processor. It should contain the needed information to understand what was needed to visualize and create this product. 
Using our skills as engineering students we tried to develop an audio digital signal processor that has enhanced processing capabilities of audio, and is user-friendly and intuitive to use.
