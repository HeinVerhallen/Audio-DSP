Because of time constrains the project is not yet finished. Some parts have been tested and work as expected. But most parts of the project including the main board and the firmware have not been finished according to the planning.

So more time is needed to finish the PCBs and assemble the Audio-DSP. As a recommendation regarding the firmware, it would have been a better approach to not use FFT as a processing method but use the direct approach instead.
