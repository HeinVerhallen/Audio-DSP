The electrical diagram of the audio DSP is divided into multiple separate diagrams to allow for the electronics to be divided into different modules. For this purpose, most voltage regulators have their own schematic, enabling them to be placed as vertical riser boards on the main board. This minimizes the risk and allows for separate testing of these voltage regulators. Custom symbols and footprints have been created in KiCAD for all these voltage regulators, so they can be used on the main board as if they were off-the-shelf components. Additionally, this saves space by better utilizing the vertical space of the product.
