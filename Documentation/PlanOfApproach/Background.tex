When listening to music it is of great importance that the speakers are tuned to the environment and the position of the listener. This is necessary to achieve the best experience. If the speakers are not correctly tuned to the surrounding environment, a digital signal processor (DSP) is used to correct this. A DSP is a specialized processor which is used for digital signal processing.  \\
