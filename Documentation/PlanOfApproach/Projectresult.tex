The goal of this project is to research how to make an audio-DSP. This raises the main research question: \textbf{“How to design an audio-DSP?”}. In the process of researching this an actual audio-DSP will be developed. From the main research question the following sub-research questions are derived:
\begin{itemize} %THIS IS TO MAKE LISTS
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em} %MAKES THE GAP SMALLER BETWEEN 2 ITEMS
	\item What is the best method for creating digital filters?
	\item What is the best method for creating digital effects?
	\item What is the most suitable anti-aliasing filter?
	\item What is the optimal needed roll-off for the anti-aliasing filter for a given bandwidth such that the noise can be negligible?
	\item What is the minimum sample frequency needed to capture the desired frequency spectrum?
	\item What is the minimum frequency range to be sampled to achieve sufficient detailed audio?
	\item What is the lowest allowable noise for decent audio?
	\item What ADC resolution is needed such that the quantization error and noise level are on par?
	\item What ADC and DAC architecture is most suitable for this application?
	\item What kind of processor is most suitable for this application?
	\item What is the permittable jitter for accurate audio?
	\item What is the maximum allowable ripple on the reference voltage for the ADC and DAC?
	\item How much RAM does the system need?
	\item How much flash does the system need?\\
\end{itemize}


The project is conducted during the minor BeCreative at Fontys. This minor takes 20 weeks and allows the students to have a budget of €300,-. Thus after 20 weeks starting from 6-2-2023 an audio-DSP will be delivered within a budget of €300,-.
The audio system has some requirements to specify the final result. These requirements are derived with the “MoSCoW” method. It must be noted that the following requirements will be confirmed by the research that will be conducted.
