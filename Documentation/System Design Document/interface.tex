As described in the System Requirements Document (SRD), the audio DSP must include multiple input and output connectors and a user interface (UI).

\section{Inputs}
The system includes the following inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DC jack to power the system
    \item CH1 RCA or jack
    \item CH2 RCA or jack
    \item CH3 XLR
    \item CH4 XLR
    \item CH5 USB (optional)
\end{itemize}
The USB input is optional and will only be added if we have sufficient time and the rest of the system is completed.
