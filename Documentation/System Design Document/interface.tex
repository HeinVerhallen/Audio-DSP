As described in the System Requirements Document (SRD), the audio DSP must incorporate multiple input and output connectors.

\section{Inputs}
The system includes the following inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item DC jack to power the system
    \item CH1 RCA or jack
    \item CH2 RCA or jack
    \item CH3 XLR
    \item CH4 XLR
    \item CH5 USB (optional)
\end{itemize}

\section{Outputs}
Output channels 1 and 2 provide the most flexibility as each channel features a balanced XLR output as well as a parallel-connected RCA and jack input. Therefore, the RCA and jack input always carry precisely the same signal. Output channels 3 through 6 exclusively have balanced XLR outputs. The audio DSP, therefore, has the following outputs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CH1 XLR and RCA or jack
    \item CH2 XLR and RCA or jack
    \item CH3 XLR
    \item CH4 XLR
    \item CH5 XLR
    \item CH6 XLR
\end{itemize}
