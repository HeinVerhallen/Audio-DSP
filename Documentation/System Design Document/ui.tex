\subsection{User interface}
To control the audio DSP, there has to be an intuitive user interface. This means that the controls of the DSP are easy to understand and easy to remember. Using the device should not be frustrating or unclear.
To accomplish this,  a series of rules is made to keep the user interface clear for the user.\\

\subsubsection*{Consistent}
The UI shouldn’t have different styled menus. The style should be consistent so that every new menu or dial is the same as every other menu. In this way using the menus is easy and recognizable. \\

\subsubsection*{Readabilty}
The text shown in menus shouldn’t be cut off. Short sentences are preferred to keep the menus clean and easy to read. If a sentence is cut off by the edge of the screen it is frustrating to try and figure out what the sentence said.  \\

\subsubsection*{Feedback}
If the system needs time to load in certain stuff or to execute a certain setting, it should be giving feedback to the user that it is loading. Loading without feedback is frustrating for the user and leads to clicking the same button several times. (Which can lead to software errors.) \\
